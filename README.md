**PruningRadixTrie - 1000x faster Radix trie** for prefix search & auto-complete

The PruningRadixTrie is a novel data structure, derived from a radix trie - but 3 orders of magnitude faster.

A [Radix Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) or Patricia Trie is a space-optimized trie (prefix tree).<br>
A **Pruning Radix trie** is a novel Radix trie algorithm, that allows pruning of the Radix trie and early termination of the lookup.

In many cases, we are not interested in a complete set of all children for a given prefix, but only in the top-k most relevant terms.
Especially for short prefixes, this results in a **massive reduction of lookup time** for the top-10 results.
On the other hand, a complete result set of millions of suggestions wouldn't be helpful at all for autocompletion.<br><br>
The lookup acceleration is achieved by storing in each node the maximum rank of all its children. By comparing this maximum child rank with the lowest rank of the results retrieved so far, we can heavily prune the trie and do early termination of the lookup for non-promising branches with low child ranks.

### Performance

![Benchmark](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HauBPEDRiwyQJ77OuJOj3g.png "Benchmark")
<br><br>
The **Pruning Radix Trie** is up to **1000x faster** than an ordinary Radix Trie.

While 36 ms for an autocomplete might seem fast enough for a single user, it becomes insufficient when we have to serve thousands of users in parallel. Then autocomplete lookups in large dictionaries are only feasible when powered by something much faster than an ordinary radix trie.

### Reproducing Benchmarks

Benchmarks are run using the [Benchmark.NET](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) project, which is the gold standard of benchmarking utilities in C#.

The graphs above are generated using Benchmark.NET to run the benchmarks, and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to generate the visual graphs. The table is generated using Benchmark.NET directly, with Github markdown exporting. To run the benchmarks yourself, clone the project, install R and the dotnet 3.1 runtime, ensure R is on your path (run Rscript), then build and run the project in release mode, from the command line. If you run the project from within Visual Studio, a debugger will be attached and will affect your results.

```
# Clean up previous benchmark runs
dotnet clean PruningRadixTrie.Benchmark.csproj
rm -Force -Recurse BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts

# Build in release mode and run benchmark
dotnet build -c release PruningRadixTrie.Benchmark.csproj
dotnet .\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\PruningRadixTrie.Benchmark.dll
```

### Dictionary

[Terms.txt](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/PruningRadixTrie/blob/master/PruningRadixTrie/terms.zip) contains 6 million unigrams and bigrams derived from English Wikipedia, with term frequency counts used for ranking. But you can use any frequency dictionary for any language and domain of your choice.

### Application:

The PruningRadixTrie is perfect for auto-completion, query completion or any other prefix search in large dictionaries.
While 37 ms for an auto-complete might seem fast enough for a **single user**, it becomes a completely different story if we have to serve **thousands of users in parallel**. Then autocomplete lookups in large dictionaries become only feasible when powered by something much faster than an ordinary radix trie.

### Usage:

**Create Object**

```
PruningRadixtrie pruningRadixTrie = new PruningRadixtrie();
```

**AddTerm:** insert term and term frequency count into Pruning Radix Trie. Frequency counts for same term are summed up.

```
pruningRadixTrie.AddTerm("microsoft", 1000);
```

**GetTopkTermsForPrefix:** retrieve the top-k most relevant terms for a given prefix from the Pruning Radix Trie.

```
string prefix="micro";
int topK=10;
var results = pruningRadixTrie.GetTopkTermsForPrefix(prefix, topK, out long termFrequencyCountPrefix);
foreach ((string term,long termFrequencyCount) in results) Console.WriteLine(term+" "+termFrequencyCount);
```

**ReadTermsFromFile:** Deserialise the Pruning Radix Trie from disk for persistence.

```
pruningRadixTrie.ReadTermsFromFile("terms.txt");
```

**WriteTermsToFile:** Serialise the Pruning Radix Trie to disk for persistence.

```
pruningRadixTrie.WriteTermsToFile("terms.txt");
```
